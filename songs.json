stifling of free expression and so on.  \r   \r but we know what's really involved: dirty books are fun!  \r that's all there is to it.  \r but you can't get up in a court and say that,  \r i suppose.  \r   \r it's simply a matter of freedom of pleasure,  \r a right which is not guaranteed by the constitution, unfortunately.  \r anyway, since people seem to be marching for their causes these days,  \r i have here a march for mine. it's called:  \r   \r smut!  \r give me smut and nothing but!  \r a dirty novel i can't shut  \r if it's uncut  \r and unsubt-le.  \r   \r i've never quibbled  \r if it was ribald.  \r i would devour  \r where others merely nibbled.  \r   \r as the judge remarked the day that he acquitted my aunt hortense,  \r \"to be smut  \r it must be ut-  \r terly without redeeming social importance.\"  \r   \r por-  \r nographic pictures i adore.  \r indecent magazines galore,  \r i like them more  \r if they're hardcore.  \r   \r bring on the obscene movies, murals, postcards, neckties, samplers, stained  \r glass windows, tattoos, anything!  \r more, more, i'm still not satisfied!  \r   \r stories of tortures  \r used by debauchers  \r lurid, licentious and vile,  \r make me smile.  \r   \r novels that pander  \r to my taste for candor  \r give me a pleasure sublime.  \r let's face it i love slime!  \r   \r old books can be indecent books,  \r though recent books are bolder.  \r for filth, i'm glad to say,  \r is in the mind of the beholder.  \r   \r when correctly viewed,  \r everything is lewd.  \r i could tell you things about peter pan  \r and the wizard of oz - there's a dirty old man!  \r   \r i thrill  \r to any book like fanny hill,  \r and i suppose i always will  \r if it is swill  \r and really fil-thy.  \r   \r who needs a hobby

the press.  \r   \r in other words: smut! i love it.  \r ah, the adventures of a slut.  \r oh, i'm a market they can't glut.  \r i don't know what  \r compares with smut.  \r hip, hip, hooray!  \r
